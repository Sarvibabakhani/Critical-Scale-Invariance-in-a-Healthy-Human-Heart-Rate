# Critical-Scale-Invariance-in-a-Healthy-Human-Heart-Rate
We demonstrate the robust scale-invariance in the probability density function (PDF) of detrended healthy human heart rate increments, which is preserved not only in a quiescent condition, but also in a dynamic state where the mean level of the heart rate is dramatically changing. Moreover, we will show that such increments are not Gaussian distributed, but they display fat tails. These results strongly support the view that a healthy human heart rate is controlled to converge continually to a critical state.
